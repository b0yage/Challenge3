This part of the code  is telling the script to get a random interger at the minimum and maximum values while setting a if command for max.

This is also setting the "random" part of the generator as its making sure that the random interger does not include a decimal.

Lastly, I made a function to get a random item from the character lists below
  While also making sure its within the character length the user wants the password to be.

This image is showing the prompts for each future function.
  It tells the user how long they want their password, while having a null function just to make sure they are able to generate another password while refreshing.
  Lastly we are also setting some error prompts just to make sure the user is inputting only numbers and making sure the user stays within the character length range.

this variables are giving the user the option if they want numbers, symbols, lower case letters, or upper case letters in their password.

lastly the list of the available characters.

Lastly this part of the code is to set up functions if the user wants certain characters (numbers, symbols, lower case, upper case) and eliminating them from the random generator if the user clicks "cancel" in the window prompt. 

Lastly it generates the password with the character limit the user chose at the first prompt.
the last two variables gets a random list, and from that list gets a random character while it adds that character to the password
